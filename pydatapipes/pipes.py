    Decorator to convert a function to a pipeline verb (without singledispatch)

    Use this version together with :func:'singledispatch` if you want to create `pipeline verbs`
    which should also be callable as a normal python function ``verb_(input, ...). If you don't
    care about having you verb callable as python function, simply use the convenience decorator
    :func:`singledispatch_pipeverb`.

    Compared to the :func:`singledispatch_pipeverb` decorator, ``func`` is **NOT** converted to a
    :func:`singledispatch` function, but if ``func`` is already a :func:`singledispatch` function,
    the ``register(...)`` method is also exposed on the decorated function.

    This is useful if you want to both expose a normal callable function and the pipeline verb
    version to the user, so that ``verb_(x,y)`` can be used as equivalent of ``x >> verb(y).

    The actual ``func`` must follow these rules to work as a pipeline verb:

    * Pipelines assume that the verbs itself are side-effect free, i.e. they do not change the
      inputs of the data pipeline. This means that actual implementations of a verb for a
      specific data source must ensure that the input is not changed in any way, e.g. if you want
      to pass on a changed value of a ``pd.DataFrame``, make a copy first.
    * The initial function (not the actual implementations for a specific data source) should
      usually do nothing but simply raise `NotImplementedError`, as it is called for all other
      types of data sources.

    To ensure a coherent API for pipeline verbs, the actual ``func`` should follow these
    conventions:

    * Pipeline verbs should actually be named as verbs, e.g. use ``input >> summarize()`` instead of
      ``input >> Summary()``
    * The actual implementation function of a ``verb()`` for a data source of class ``Type``
      should be called ``verb_Type(...)``,  e.g. ``select_DataFrame()``
    * If you want to expose both the pipeline verb and a normal function (which can be called
      directly), the pipeline verb should get the "normal" verb name and the function version
      should get an underscore ``_`` appended, e.g. ``x >> verb()`` -> ``verb_(x)``
